                <p class="introduction__orign">On April 22, 1500, Pedro √Ålvares Cabral, sailing on behalf of Portugal, arrived in Brazil, sighting unknown lands on the coast of Bahia. This discovery occurred during an expedition that sought to establish trade routes with the Indies. Cabral took possession of the lands in the name of Portugal, naming them the "Island of the True Cross" ("Ilha de Vera Cruz"). From that moment, Portugal began the colonization of Brazil, exploring its natural resources, establishing villages, and introducing sugarcane agriculture. The country remained a Portuguese colony until 1822 when it achieved its independence.

                <p class="introduction__name">One name that catches attention is "Red like an ember." For those who don't know, it is the name of Brazil. It refers to the red color of a wood used for dyeing fabrics that the Portuguese found in the country - the Brazilwood. Its origin is the Celtic word "barkino," which in Spanish became "barcino," and later Brazil.</p>
